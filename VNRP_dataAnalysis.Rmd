This script uses data from the rawdata sheet in FluxData_NWQM&LTREB_27Oct2022

After importing the data and grouping events by week to avoid date mismatches among sites we'll do similar analyses to Valett et al first and also add efficiency metrics.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2); library(dplyr)
#upload the data
NPD_raw_data = read.table("clipboard", header = T, sep="\t")

NPD_raw_data$event_num <- strftime(NPD_raw_data$date, format = "%V")

```
